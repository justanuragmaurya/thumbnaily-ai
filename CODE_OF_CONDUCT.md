**Code of Conduct for Thumbnaily-AI**

***Our Pledge***

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Thumbnaily-AI project pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to fostering an environment that is not only productive and innovative but also inclusive and respectful for all.

***Our Standards***

We strive to:
- **Be Friendly and Patient:** Remember that you might be communicating with someone for whom English is a second language, or who may not have the same context or experience level as you. Assume good faith.
- **Be Welcoming:** We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities.
- **Be Respectful:** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. Disagreement is an opportunity to learn from different perspectives.
- **Be Clear and Constructive:** We value clear, effective communication. Be direct and constructive in your feedback, especially when discussing AI models and their outputs.
- **Take Responsibility for Our Impact:** Our words and actions have consequences. If someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully and apologize sincerely.
